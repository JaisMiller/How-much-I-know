<h1>How much Do I Know?</h1>
<p> I'm not sure how much I know about coding, but, I'm doing this, right? that proves I know atleast a tiny bit about it. Coding is fun, and I would encourage anyone to do it. It's one of the many things I would like to do when I grow up. I would love to be a game maker or computer builder, but right now I'm mainly focusing on coding and creating websites/games.</p>

<p>These are some of the simple commands I know.<p>
<u1>
<li>The [p] element lets you create a paragraph.</li>
<li>The [title] element lets you create a title that people will see when they click on the link (I think)</li>
<li>The [!DOCTYPEhtml] element always is your first line of code on your website</li>
<li>The [img] element lets put images on your website page, but there are some more codes involved in the <img/> element.</li>
<li>the [img] element is a self closing command, so there will be no closing element at the end.</li>
<li>The [h1] element lets you create the title that people will see when they are on the website.</li>
</u1>
<p> These are just some of the commands I know.</p>
