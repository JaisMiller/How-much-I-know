<h1>How much Do I Know?</h1>
<p> I'm not sure how much I know about coding, but, I'm doing this, right? that proves I know atleast a tiny bit about it. Coding is fun, and I would encourage anyone to do it. It's one of the many things I would like to do when I grow up. I would love to be a game maker or computer builder, but right now I'm mainly focusing on coding and creating websites/games.</p>
